### SPECTRA:
- cortex segmentaion: moving from diaphysis towards hand joint segmentation

### General chat
- github issues + forum
- team campus: metadata about the community.. documentation to navigate the community


### QUESTIONS - common code
- collection of i/o for different biomedical imaging files
- standardize bone histomorphometric methods

#### Ravers
1. Setup **ravers**: high-level-maintainers team across groups:
   - maintainers can activate and deactivate themselves for a period of time
   - maintainers commit themselves for a specific duration of time
2. Create bucket list of open issues relevant to the community
   - maintainers take care of common goals and issues (submitting them and )
3. Compile meta-documentation about the community (what are the groups doing, what is available within each group, what are the goals)

#### big-picture-philosophical thing
4. kick-off the **big-picture-philosophical thing**
   - Ryan, student from Sarah will receive directives on how to setup a webpage with a community library of tools and notebooks

#### Targeting funds
- allocate money through separate (individual) grant applications
- it seems difficult to tackle reproducibility funders with the current scale of our community
- cost action meetings support
- something very sepcific is more likely to get through
  - the community could prepare a letter of support and increase chances by applying with a single realistic application
  - show that the community has a vision and a common statement would reinforce grant claim
- rather than funding staff to do developemnet try to target community growth in a sustainable way
  - at least in the private ecosystem..
  - show governance, common intent and commitment
  - what is the thing that would never happen if our community won't get together

#### next meetings
- online meeting in 3 months 
- in-person meeting (every 2 years?), possibly joint with QMSKI to reduce travel impact!
