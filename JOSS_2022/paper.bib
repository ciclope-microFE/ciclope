	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that, in addition to bone mass, bone microarchitecture and its mechanical load distribution are important factors for the determination of bone strength. Recently, it has been shown that new high-resolution imaging techniques in combination with new modeling algorithms based on the finite element (FE) method can account for these additional factors. Such models thus could provide more relevant information for the estimation of bone failure load. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether results of whole-bone micro-FE (μFE) analyses with models based on three-dimensional peripheral quantitative computer tomography (3D-pQCT) images (isotropic voxel resolution of 165 μm) could predict the failure load of the human radius more accurately than results with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or bone morphology measurements. For this purpose, μFE models were created using 54 embalmed cadaver arms. It was assumed that bone failure would be initiated if a certain percentage of the bone tissue (varied from 1\% to 7\%) would be strained beyond the tissue yield strain. The external force that produced this tissue strain was calculated from the FE analyses. These predictions were correlated with results of real compression testing on the same cadaver arms. The results of these compression tests were also correlated with results of DXA and structural measurements of these arms. The compression tests produced Colles-type fractures in the distal 4 cm of the radius. The predicted failure loads calculated from the FE analysis agreed well with those measured in the experiments (R2 = 0.75 p {\textless} 0.001). Lower correlations were found with bone mass (R2 = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.001) and bone structural parameters (R2 = 0.57 p {\textless} 0.001). We conclude that application of the techniques investigated here can lead to a better prediction of the bone failure load for bone in vivo than is possible from DXA measurements, structural parameters, or a combination thereof.},

The advantage of the PC is that a simple strain-threshold and a tissue volume fraction can be used to predict failure properties. In this study, the PC is compared to materially nonlinear μFE analyses, where the bone tissue is modelled as an elastic, damageable material. The goal was to investigate for which outcomes the PC is sufficient and when a nonlinear (NL) simulation is required. Three types of simulation results were compared: (1) prediction of the failure load, (2) load sharing of cortical and trabecular regions, and (3) distribution of local damaged / overstrained tissue at the maximum sustainable load. The failure load obtained experimentally could be predicted well with both the PC and the NL simulations using linear regression. Although the PC strongly overestimated the failure load, it was sufficient to predict adequately normalized apparent results. An optimised PC (oPC) was proposed which uses experimental data to calibrate the individual volume of overstrained tissue. The main areas of local over-straining predicted by the oPC were the same as estimated by the NL simulation, although the oPC predicted more diffuse regions. However, the oPC relied on an individual calibration requiring the experimental failure load while the NL simulation required no a-priori knowledge of the experimental failure load.},

Therefore, we investigated the effects of thresholding techniques on microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) based finite element models of trabecular bone. Three types of thresholding techniques were applied to 16-bit micro-CT images of trabecular bone to create three different models per specimen. Bone volume fractions and apparent moduli were predicted and compared to experimental results. In addition, trabecular tissue mechanical parameters and morphological parameters were compared among different models. Our findings suggest that predictions of apparent mechanical properties and structural properties agree well with experimental measurements regardless of the choice of thresholding methods or the format of micro-CT images.},

To study and predict trabecular bone elastic and yield properties, micro-finite element (micro-FE) models were successfully applied. However, trabecular bone strength predictions require micro-FE models incorporating post-yield behavior of trabecular bone tissue. Due to experimental difficulties, such data is currently not available. Here we used micro-FE modeling to determine failure behavior of trabecular bone tissue indirectly, by iteratively fitting FE simulation to experimental results. Failure parameters were fitted to an isotropic plasticity model based on Hill's yield function, using materially and geometrically nonlinear micro-FE models of seven bovine trabecular bone specimens. The predictive value of the averaged effective tissue properties was subsequently tested. The results showed that compression softening had to be included on the tissue level in order to accurately describe the apparent-level behavior of the bone specimens. A sensitivity study revealed that the simulated response was less sensitive to variations in the post-yield properties of the bone tissue than variations in the elastic and yield properties. Due to fitting of the tissue properties, apparent-level behavior could be accurately reproduced for each specimen separately. Predictions based on the averaged and fixed tissue properties were less accurate, due to inter-specimen variations in the tissue properties.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of cancellous bone and the biological response of the tissue to mechanical loading are related to deformation and strain in the trabeculae during function. Due to the small size of trabeculae, their motion is difficult to measure. To avoid the need to measure trabecular motions during loading the finite element method has been used to estimate trabecular level mechanical deformation. This analytical approach has been empirically successful in that the analytical models are solvable and their results correlate with the macroscopically measured stiffness and strength of bones. The present work is a direct comparison of finite element predictions to measurements of the deformation and strain at near trabecular level. Using the method of digital volume correlation, we measured the deformation and calculated the strain at a resolution approaching the trabecular level for cancellous bone specimens loaded in uniaxial compression. Smoothed results from linearly elastic finite element models of the same mechanical tests were correlated to the empirical three-dimensional (3D) deformation in the direction of loading with a coefficient of determination as high as 97\% and a slope of the prediction near one. However, real deformations in the directions perpendicular to the loading direction were not as well predicted by the analytical models. Our results show, that the finite element modeling of the internal deformation and strain in cancellous bone can be accurate in one direction but that this does not ensure accuracy for all deformations and strains.},

The aim of this study was to validate microFE models predictions of local displacements for vertebral bodies and to evaluate the effect of the elastic tissue modulus on model’s predictions of axial forces. Four porcine thoracic vertebrae were axially compressed in situ, in a step-wise fashion and scanned at approximately 39μm resolution in preloaded and loaded conditions. A global digital volume correlation (DVC) approach was used to compute the full-field displacements. Homogeneous, isotropic and linear elastic microFE models were generated with boundary conditions assigned from the interpolated displacement field measured from the DVC. Measured and predicted local displacements were compared for the cortical and trabecular compartments in the middle of the specimens. Models were run with two different tissue moduli defined from microindentation data (12.0GPa) and a back-calculation procedure (4.6GPa). The predicted sum of axial reaction forces was compared to the experimental values for each specimen. MicroFE models predicted more than 87\% of the variation in the displacement measurements (R2 = 0.87–0.99). However, model predictions of axial forces were largely overestimated (80–369\%) for a tissue modulus of 12.0GPa, whereas differences in the range 10–80\% were found for a back-calculated tissue modulus. The specimen with the lowest density showed a large number of elements strained beyond yield and the highest predictive errors. This study shows that the simplest microFE models can accurately predict quantitatively the local displacements and qualitatively the strain distribution within the vertebral body, independently from the considered bone types.},

Trabecular bone specimens from porcine femurs were loaded under a uniaxial compression experimentally and computationally. The apparent behaviors computed using von Mises, Drucker-Prager, and Cast Iron plasticity models were compared. Secondly, the effect of bone volume fraction was studied by changing the bone volume fraction of a trabecular bone sample while keeping the same basic architecture. Also, constitutive models' parameters of the tissue were calibrated for porcine bone, and the effects of different parameters on resulting apparent response were investigated through a parametric study. The calibrated effective tissue elastic modulus of porcine trabecular bone was 10±1.2 GPa, which is in the lower range of modulus values reported in the literature for human and bovine trabecular bones (4–23.8 GPa). It was also observed that, unlike elastic modulus, yield properties of tissue could not be uniquely calibrated by fitting an apparent response from simulations to experiments under a uniaxial compression. Our results demonstrated that using these 3 tissue constitutive models had only a slight effect on the apparent response. As expected, there was a significant change in the apparent response with varying bone volume fraction. Also, both apparent modulus and maximum stress had a linear relation with bone volume fraction.},

	abstract = {Non-destructive 3D micro-computed tomography (microCT) based finite element (microFE) model is popular in estimating bone mechanical properties in recent decades. From a fundamental scientific perspective, as the primary function of the skeleton is mechanical in nature, a lot of related biological and physiological mechanisms are mechano-regulated that becomes evident at the tissue scale. In all these research it is essential to known with the best possible accuracy the displacements, stresses, and strains induced by given loads in the bone tissue. Correspondingly, verification and validation of the microFE model has become crucial in evaluating the quality of its predictions. Because of the complex geometry of cancellous bone tissue, only a few studies have investigated the local convergence behaviour of such models and post-yield behaviour has not been reported. Moreover, the validation of their prediction of local properties remains challenging. Recent technique of digital volume correlation (DVC) combined with microCT images can measure internal displacements and deformation of bone specimen and therefore is able to provide experimental data for validation. However, the strain error of this experimental method tends to be a lot higher (in the order of several thousand microstrains) for spatial resolutions of 10-20 µm, typical element size of microFE models. Strictly speaking no validation of strain is possible. Therefore, the goal of this thesis it to conduct a local convergence study of cancellous bone microFE models generated using three microCT-based tissue modelling methods (homogeneous tetrahedral model, homogeneous hexahedral model and heterogeneous hexahedral model); to validate these models’ prediction in terms of displacement using the novel DVC technique; and finally to compare the strain field predicted by three tissue modelling methods, in order to explore the effect of specific idealisations/simplifications on the prediction of strain.},

	abstract = {New treatments against osteoporosis require testing in animal models and the mouse tibia is among the most common studied anatomical sites. In vivo micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) based micro-Finite Element (microFE) models can be used for predicting the bone strength non-invasively, after proper validation against experiments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of different microCT-based bone parameters and microFE models to predict tibial structural mechanical properties in compression. Twenty tibiae were scanned at 10.4 μm voxel size and subsequently tested in uniaxial compression at 0.03 mm/s until failure. Stiffness and failure load were measured from the load-displacement curves. Standard morphometric parameters were measured from the microCT images. The spatial distribution of bone mineral content (BMC) was evaluated by dividing the tibia into 40 regions. MicroFE models were generated by converting each microCT image into a voxel-based mesh with homogeneous isotropic material properties. Failure load was estimated by using different failure criteria, and the optimized parameters were selected by minimising the errors with respect to experimental measurements. Experimental and predicted stiffness were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.65, error = 14\% ± 8\%). Normalized failure load was best predicted by microFE models (R2 = 0.81, error = 9\% ± 6\%). Failure load was not correlated to the morphometric parameters and weakly correlated with some geometrical parameters (R2 {\textless} 0.37). In conclusion, microFE models can improve the current estimation of the mouse tibia structural properties and in this study an optimal failure criterion has been defined. Since it is a non-invasive method, this approach can be applied longitudinally for evaluating temporal changes in the bone strength.},

Micro-Finite Element (microFE) models based on micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) images can estimate bone mechanical properties non-invasively but their outputs need to be validated with experiments. Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) can provide experimental measurements of displacements over the whole bone volume. In this study we applied DVC to validate the local predictions of microFE models of the mouse tibia in compression. Six mouse tibiae were stepwise compressed within a microCT system. MicroCT images were acquired in four configurations with applied compression of 0.5 N (preload), 6.5 N, 13.0 N and 19.5 N. Failure load was measured after the last scan. A global DVC algorithm was applied to the microCT images in order to obtain the displacement field over the bone volume. Homogeneous, isotropic linear hexahedral microFE models were generated from the images collected in the preload configuration with boundary conditions interpolated from the DVC displacements at the extremities of the tibia. Experimental displacements from DVC and numerical predictions were compared at corresponding locations in the middle of the bone. Stiffness and strength were also estimated from each model and compared with the experimental measurements. The magnitude of the displacement vectors predicted by microFE models was highly correlated with experimental measurements (R2 {\textgreater}0.82). Higher but still reasonable errors were found for the Cartesian components. The models tended to overestimate local displacements in the longitudinal direction (R2 = 0.69–0.90, slope of the regression line=0.50–0.97). Errors in the prediction of structural mechanical properties were 14\% ± 11\% for stiffness and 9\% ± 9\% for strength. In conclusion, the DVC approach has been applied to the validation of microFE models of the mouse tibia.

	abstract = {Trabecular bone is natural material with heterogeneous tissue properties. The effect of tissue heterogeneity on the micromechanical behavior of trabecular bone is commonly evaluated by microCT-based finite element (microFE) analysis. Results from prior work remain inconclusive and lack of experimental validation. To address these issues, we combined microFE analysis with mechanical testing and microCT-based digital volume correlation (DVC), as a validation for the microFE approach. Porcine trabecular specimens were tested in compression as sequential microCT scans were taken. DVC was performed to extract “realistic” boundary conditions that were applied to microFE models, and to measure microstructural deformation and strain of the trabecular specimens. Heterogeneous and homogeneous microFE models of each trabecular specimen were created and compared with the experimentally measured microstructural displacement and strains. Results showed strong correlations between DVC-measured and microFE-predicted trabecular displacement and strain fields (R2{\textgreater}0.9, p{\textless}0.05), regardless of heterogeneous or homogeneous material assignments. The heterogeneous and homogeneous models predicted similar magnitudes for maximum or minimum principal strains (R2=1, p{\textless}0.05). However, incorporation of tissue heterogeneity decreased more than 16.5\% in the overall stress level of the trabecular tissues. Regardless, very strong correlations were found between the heterogeneous and homogeneous model-predicted principal strains or stresses. These results together suggest that tissue heterogeneity may have little effect on microFE modeling of typical elastic displacement and strains in the trabecular bone, suggesting that homogeneous material models might be sufficient to predict general trabecular micromechanics.},

	abstract = {High-resolution finite element models of trabecular bone can be used to study trabecular structure-function relationships, elasticity, multiaxial strength, and tissue remodelling in more detail than experiments. Beside effects of the model size, scan/analysis resolution, segmentation process, etc., the type of the applied boundary conditions (BCs) have a strong influence on the predicted elastic properties. Appropriate BCs have to be applied on hexahedral digital finite element models in order to obtain effective elastic properties. Homogeneous displacement BCs as proposed by Van Rietbergen et al. (J Biomech 29(12):1653-1657, 1996) lead to "apparent" rather than to "effective" elastic properties. This study provides some answers concerning such differences by comparing various BC types (uniform displacement, mixed BCs, periodic BCs), different volume element definitions (original and mirrored models), and several bone volume fractions (BVTV ranging from 6.5 to 37.6\%). First, the mixed BCs formulated by Hazanov (Arch Appl Mech 68(6):385-394, 1998) are theoretically extended to shear loading of a porous media. Second, six human bone samples are analyzed, their orthotropic Young's moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratios computed and compared. It is found that the proposed mixed BCs give exactly the same effective elastic properties as periodic BCs if a periodic and orthotropic micro-structured material is used and thus denoted as "periodicity compatible" mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). As bone samples were shown to be nearly orthotropic for volume element side lengths {\textgreater} or =5 mm the proposed mixed BCs turn out to be the best choice because they give again essentially the same overall elastic properties as periodic BCs. For bone samples of smaller dimensions ( {\textless} 5 mm) with a strong anisotropy (beyond orthotropy) uniform displacement BCs remain applicable but they can significantly overestimate the effective stiffness.},

In this paper, we propose to train spherical convolutional neural networks (SphCNNs) to estimate this tensor. Information of the edges, trabecular thickness, and spacing are summarized in functions on the unitary sphere used as inputs for the SphCNNs. The concomitant dimensionality reduction makes it possible to train neural networks on relatively small datasets. The predicted tensors were compared to the stiffness tensors computed by using the micro-finite element method (μFE), which was considered as the gold standard, and models based on fourth-order fabric tensors. Combining edges and trabecular thickness yields significant improvements in the accuracy compared to the methods based on fourth-order fabric tensors. From the results, SphCNNs are promising for replacing the more expensive μFE stiffness estimations.},

	abstract = {Bone regeneration in critical-sized defects is a clinical challenge, with biomaterials under constant development aiming at enhancing the natural bone healing process. The delivery of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in appropriate carriers represents a promising strategy for bone defect treatment but optimisation of the spatial-temporal release is still needed for the regeneration of bone with biological, structural, and mechanical properties comparable to the native tissue. Nonlinear micro finite element (μFE) models can address some of these challenges by providing a tool able to predict the biomechanical strength and microdamage onset in newly formed bone when subjected to physiological or supraphysiological loads. Yet, these models need to be validated against experimental data. In this study, experimental local displacements in newly formed bone induced by osteoinductive biomaterials subjected to in situ X-ray computed tomography compression in the apparent elastic regime and measured using digital volume correlation (DVC) were used to validate μFE models. Displacement predictions from homogeneous linear μFE models were highly correlated to DVC-measured local displacements, while tissue heterogeneity capturing mineralisation differences showed negligible effects. Nonlinear μFE models improved the correlation and showed that tissue microdamage occurs at low apparent strains. Microdamage seemed to occur next to large cavities or in biomaterial-induced thin trabeculae, independent of the mineralisation. While localisation of plastic strain accumulation was similar, the amount of damage accumulated in these locations was slightly higher when including material heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the ability of the nonlinear μFE model to capture local microdamage in newly formed bone tissue and can be exploited to improve the current understanding of healing bone and mechanical competence. This will ultimately aid the development of BMPs delivery systems for bone defect treatment able to regenerate bone with optimal biological, mechanical, and structural properties.},

	abstract = {The structural integrity of cancellous bone, which is essential to skeletal load-bearing capacity, is governed chiefly by apparent density, trabecular architecture, and tissue material properties. Metabolic bone disorders like osteoporosis can affect each of these factors separately, resulting in compromised load-bearing function. While the impact of apparent density and architecture on bone structural behavior has been well-documented, much less is known about the influence of tissue material properties, particularly in osteoporotic bone. The goal of this study was to isolate the influence of tissue material properties on normal and osteoporotic cancellous bone structural integrity, indicated by the apparent elastic modulus under uniaxial compression, using finite element (FE) models derived from 3D microcomputed tomography images. Three sets of models with increasing material detail were studied: 1) universal tissue elastic modulus, 2) specimen-specific average tissue modulus, and 3) heterogeneous tissue modulus. FE results were compared to matched parameters from physical testing. Increasing material detail did not significantly affect model predictions for normal bone. For osteoporotic bone, incorporating a specimen-specific tissue modulus significantly improved the ability of FE models to predict the apparent elastic modulus of physical specimens compared to using a universal tissue modulus. Incorporating material heterogeneity also improved model performance compared to models with a universal tissue modulus but did not afford significant improvement over models with specimen-specific average properties. We conclude that, while the influence of bone apparent density and trabecular architecture on structural integrity are dominant in healthy bone, average material properties also play a role in osteoporotic bone. Osteoporosis is diagnosed based primarily on apparent density, so these results highlight the need to consider other patient-specific differences that may affect average material properties, such as bone remodeling rate, in clinical assessments of osteoporotic bone structural integrity.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Elastic and strength properties of lamellar tissue are essential to analyze the mechanical behaviour of bone at the meso- or macro-scale. Although many efforts have been made to model the architecture of cancellous bone, in general, isotropic elastic constants are assumed for tissue modelling, neglecting its non-isotropic behaviour. Therefore, isotropic damage laws are often used to estimate the bone failure. The main goals of this work are: (1) to present a new model for the estimation of the elastic properties of lamellar tissue which includes the bone mineral density (BMD) and the microporosity, (2) to address the numerical modelling of cancellous bone damage using an orthotropic failure criterion and a discrete damage mechanics analysis, including the novel approach for the tissue elastic properties aforementioned. Methods: Numerical homogenization has been used to estimate the elastic properties of lamellar bone considering BMD and microporosity. Microcomputed Tomography (μ-CT) scans have been performed to obtain the micro-finite element (μ-FE) model of cancellous bone from a vertebra of swine. In this model, lamellar tissue is orientated by considering a unidirectional layer pattern being the mineralized collagen fibrils aligned with the most representative geometrical feature of the trabeculae network. We have considered the Hashin’s failure criterion and the Material Property Degradation (MPDG) method for simulating the onset and evolution of bone damage. Results: The terms of the stiffness matrix for lamellar tissue are derived as functions of the BMD and microporosity at tissue scale. Results obtained for the apparent yield strain values agree with experimental values found in the literature. The influence of the damage parameters on the bone mechanics behaviour is also presented. Conclusions: Stiffness matrix of lamellar tissue depends on both BMD and microporosity. The new approach presented in this work enables to analyze the influence of the BMD and porosity on the mechanical response of bone. Lamellar tissue orientation has to be considered in the mechanical analysis of the cancellous bone. An orthotropic failure criterion can be used to analyze the bone failure onset instead of isotropic criteria. The elastic property degradation method is an efficient procedure to analyze the failure propagation in a 3D numerical model.},

	abstract = {High-resolution architecture-based finite element models are commonly used for characterizing the mechanical behavior of cancellous bone. The vast majority of studies use homogeneous material properties to model trabecular tissue. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate that inhomogeneous finite element models that account for microcomputed tomography-measured tissue modulus variability more accurately predict the apparent stiffness of cancellous bone than homogeneous models, and to examine the sensitivity of an inhomogeneous model to the degree of tissue property variability. We tested five different material cases in finite element models of ten cancellous cubes in simulated uniaxial compression. Three of these cases were inhomogeneous and two were homogeneous. Four of these cases were unique to each specimen, and the remaining case had the same tissue modulus for all specimens. Results from all simulations were compared with measured elastic moduli from previous experiments. Tissue modulus variability for the most accurate of the three inhomogeneous models was then artificially increased to simulate the effects of non-linear CT-attenuation-modulus relationships. Uniqueness of individual models was more critical for model accuracy than level of inhomogeneity. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous models that were unique to each specimen had at least 8\% greater explanatory power for apparent modulus than models that applied the same material properties to all specimens. The explanatory power for apparent modulus of models with a tissue modulus coefficient of variation (COV) range of 21–31\% was 13\% greater than homogeneous models (COV=0). The results of this study indicate that inhomogenous finite element models that have tissue moduli unique to each specimen more accurately predict the elastic behavior of cancellous cubic specimens than models that have common tissue moduli between all specimens.},

The anisotropic elasticity of bone is described by a morphology-based model and distinct damage behaviour in tension and compression by a halfspacewise generalized Hill criterion. The plastic criterion is based on the intact elastic compliance tensor. The algorithm applies three distinct projections based on the relationship between the internal variables and criteria.

To evaluate the attributes of the produced micro-geometries, foam segments and single struts are investigated by light and electron microscopy in 2D, and synchrotron micro-computed tomography in 3D. Mechanical properties are determined by macro/micro-mechanical testing and nanoindentation. In the microstructure of the gray cast iron struts, both flake-like coarse type A and locally fine undercooled type D graphite particles are observed. The distribution of the two graphite types is heterogeneous and is the likely cause for the large scatter of the mechanical properties of the single struts. The high graphite content and the resulting brittle behavior of the struts lead to strong serrations in the stress-strain curve of the foams with a negative effect on energy absorption. We found a relatively low energy absorption efficiency of below 50\% as compared to 75\% in 316L austenitic steel struts. The small specimen size results in scale effects which strongly influence the mechanical properties of the foams. Further improvement in the fabrication of gray cast iron foams is needed to tailor graphite distributions and optimize performance of cast iron-based foams.},

	abstract = {When mammalian teeth breakdown food, several juxtaposed dental tissues work mechanically together, while balancing requirements of food comminution and avoiding damage to the oral tissues. One important way to achieve this is by channeling mastication forces into the surrounding jaw bone through a thin and compliant soft tissue, the periodontal ligament (PDL). As a result, during a typical chewing stroke, each tooth moves quite substantially in its anchor-site. Here we report a series of experiments, where we study the reaction of three-rooted teeth to a single chewing event by finite element (FE) modelling. The nonlinear behaviour of the PDL is simulated by a hyperelastic material model and the in silico results are validated by our own in vitro experiments. We examine the displacement response of the complete tooth-PDL-bone complex to increasing chewing loads. We observe that small spatially-varying geometric adjustments to the thickness of the PDL lead to strong changes in observed tooth reaction movement, as well as PDL strain and bone stress. When reproducing the regionally varying thickness of the PDL observed in vivo, FE simulations reveal subtle but significant tooth motion that leads to an even distribution of the stresses in the jaw bone, and to lower strains in the PDL. Our in silico experiments also reproduce the results of experiments performed by others on different animal models and are therefore useful for overcoming the difficulties of obtaining tooth-PDL-bone loading estimates in vivo. This data thus enhances our understanding of the role the variable PDL geometry plays in the tooth-PDL-bone complex during mastication.},

	abstract = {Micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis became a standard tool for the evaluation of trabecular bone mechanical properties. The accuracy of micro-FE models for linear analyses is well established. However, the accuracy of recently developed nonlinear micro-FE models for simulations of trabecular bone failure is not known. In this study, a trabecular bone specimen was compressed beyond the apparent yield point. The experiment was simulated using different micro-FE meshes with different element sizes and types, and material models based on cortical bone. The results from the simulations were compared with experimental results to study the effects of the different element and material models. It was found that a decrease in element size from 80 to 40 μm had little effect on predicted post-yield behaviour. Element type and material model had significant effects. Nevertheless, none of the established material models for cortical bone were able to predict the typical descent in the load-displacement curve seen during compression of trabecular bone.},
