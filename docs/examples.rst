This section contains examples of **ciclope** pipelines.

.. Examples can be run in your browser using the Binder link at the top of the page.

The trabecular bone micrCT dataset used in the examples is part of the public collection of the Living Human Digital Library (LHDL), a project financed by the European Commission (grant ID:
`FP6-IST 026932 <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/026932>`_
).
Human tissues in the LHDL project were collected according to the body donation program of Universit√® Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), partner of the project.
For info on the dataset see
`here <http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/lhdl/>`_
.

You can run all
`Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
examples on your local machine.
You can also execute the pipelines from the command line. The header of each example shows the shell command to launch the pipeline as a script.
